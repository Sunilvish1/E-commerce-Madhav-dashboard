Here's an overview of how you can present these aspects in your dashboard:

Top Performers:
Create a visual representation of top-performing subcategories or products based on sales or profit. You can use visuals like bar charts, tables, or cards to display the highest performers.
Implement slicers or filters to allow users to view top performers for specific time periods, such as months or quarters.

Average Order Value:
This metric is crucial for understanding the average monetary value of each order.
Implement trend analysis to show how the average order value is changing over time.

Enhancements for State Contributions:
To further enrich the information about state contributions, consider using a map visualization. This can provide a geographical representation of sales contributions, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify regions with the highest impact.

Narrative and Insights:
Integrate text boxes or narrative elements in your dashboard to provide context and insights. For example, you can highlight trends, anomalies, or key observations based on the data.

User Interactivity:
Make sure your dashboard is interactive, allowing users to explore data dynamically. Incorporate slicers, filters, and drill-through actions to enable users to focus on specific aspects of the data that are relevant to their analysis.
